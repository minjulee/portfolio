  "readme": "Hapi Named Routes\n=================\n\nHapi plugin to add named routes to your view templates.\n\n## Goal:\nIn your view templates, instead of always typing the path in your links, you can now have access to the route name variable. It will just print the path.\n\n## How it works:\n\nIn your view template you can now access `path.name` where name is the id of the route.\n\nTo name a route you need to pass the config object to the route with the id being defined.\n\nExample:\n```\n// Route Config\nvar about = {\n    handler: function (request, reply) {\n        reply.view('about');\n    },\n    id: 'about'\n};\n\n// Array of routes for Hapi\nroutes = [\n    {\n        method: 'GET',\n        path: '/about',\n        config: about\n    }\n]\n\nserver.route(routes);\n```\nBased on the example above you now have access to `path.about` in your view templates, and will print out the routes path `/about`.\n\nHandlebars:\n`<a href=\"{{path.about}}\">About</a>`\n\nJade:\n`a(href=\"#{path.about}\") About`\n\n### Breaking changes\nIn Hapi 8.0.0 the `id` property for a route was added to allow a developer to access a route path using [`server.lookup()`](#serverlookupid). As of hapi-named-routes `0.3.0` we use this `id` instead of `app.name` like we previoisly used.\n\n### Other\n\nYou can see this being used in the Hapi Ninja boilerplate example.
